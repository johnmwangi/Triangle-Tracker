## Description

This is a detailed description of your application, including its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

-   This is a great place
-   to list setup instructions
-   in a simple
-   easy-to-understand
-   format
    I want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run my app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?
    ## Known Bugs
    Their is still a lot to be covered on Triangle base on angles and calculation method which will cover on the next project.
    ## Technologies Used
    The whole process was carried out by the use of HTML, CSS, and mostly JAVASCRIPT.
    ## Support and contact details
    The project need to go on, get me at jonemwas356@gmail.com incase of any additional or sutraction of an idea.

    | Behaviuor                               | Behaviour input | Behaviour output     |
    |-----------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
    | Shows if it is an Equilateral Triangle. | 2*2*2             | Equlateral Triangle. |
    | shows if it is an Isosceles Triangle.   | 3*3*4             | Isosceles Triangle.  |
    | shows if it is Scalane Triangle.        | 4*3*2             | Scalene Triangle.    |
    | shows if it is not a Triangle           | no values       | not a triangle.      |
